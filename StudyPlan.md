# Weekly Study Plan
- This week, we are planning on beginning our Preparation journey for the AP Exam.
- On this page, I will be highlighting what my plans are for every day of the week (including some individual prep I will be doing)

## Monday
- Today is mainly just for coming up with the plans for the week
- I have already started reading the Barrons AP Review book, and I have reached Unit 6, so I will plan to read that tonight and take the unit's practice test

## Tuesday
- In class today, we plan to take a practice MC, so that will be part of the plan
- I will read and take the practice test for Unit 7 in the Barron's book
- I plan on also doing a practice FRQ (but this time on paper) so that I can get accustommed to the pencil-paper design of the AP exam

## Wednesday
- In class today, we will plan to review the MC and the most missed questions on the practice MC
- I won't really be able to do much work after school since I leave for Georgia Tech tonight

## Thursday
- While I will be in Georgia Tech, I still plan on trying to take the practice FRQ and crossover with Rachel and Bryant, who are apparantly also going to Georgia

## Friday
- I will mainly be doing Barron's Review in the free time I have in Georgia, in which I will try to cover Unit 8 and 9 and do the Practice MC's

## Backburners and Other Ideas
- Chapter 10 of the Barron's book (which I believe is also the last)
- A couple of practice tests
- Consider watching the AP Review videos that begin today on youtube.
- Review the notes that I will be taking and make a study guide out of it
